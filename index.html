        Not much is known about Wolf O'Donnell's early life other than he used to be the leader of a gang of space
        pirates, presumably the same pirates that duelled with the Cornerian army at Sector Z in a battle that left much
        space wreckage. It is also known that Wolf has been wanted by the Cornerian army for years, because of crimes
        such as larceny and treason. Before the Lylat Wars, Team Star Fox and Star Wolf shared a long and bitter history
        with one another, despite mutual respect. It was believed that Wolf had somehow been involved in the
        disappearance of James McCloud, who was Fox's father. Following the ape's exile, when Andross offered Wolf money
        to lead a mercenary team against Fox McCloud and the Star Fox team, he jumped at the chance to see Fox fail. He
        teamed up with Pigma Dengar, Andross's nephew, Andrew Oikonny, and found the mysterious Leon Powalski in a rough
        bar on Venom. Wolf then sought to destroy Star Fox and protect Andross, so that he may be feared throughout the
        galaxy. When Wolf's team was hired by Andross to take down Star Fox, Wolf wanted nothing more than to fulfill
        these orders and prove himself to be as good, or better, than Fox McCloud.
